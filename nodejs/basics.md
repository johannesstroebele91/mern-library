# Basics

- Node.js is a JS runtime (engine)
- that allows to execute JS
- outside of the browser
  - so the browser is a host environment for JS
  - but also operation systems (linux, ...)

# Features

- some APIs dropped (e.g. DOM, Geolocation, ...)
- but several added (e.g. filesystem, http )

# Execution of JS files

Node.js enables to exectue JS files by

- navigating in to the folder
- executing the app with `node app.js`

# Scripts

Server-side scripts with Node.js are run only once

- to start the server and
- to register all middlewares
